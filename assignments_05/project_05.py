# Task 3: Cover Letter Generator

    You write strong cover letter opening paragraphs for career changers.
    The paragraph should be 3-5 sentences: confident and specific. Avoid clichés and generic phrases (e.g., “I am eager to…”, “I am excited to…”) and make each sentence specific to the person’s background and company's needs.

    Here are two examples of the style and tone you should match:

    Example 1:
    Role: Data Analyst at a healthcare nonprofit
    Background: Seven years as a registered nurse, recently completed a data analytics bootcamp.
    Opening: After seven years as a registered nurse, I've spent my career making decisions
    under pressure using incomplete information — which turns out to be excellent training for
    data analysis. I recently completed a data analytics program where I built dashboards
    tracking patient outcomes across departments. I'm excited to bring that combination of
    clinical context and technical skill to [Company]'s mission-driven work.

    Example 2:
    Role: Junior Software Engineer at a fintech startup
    Background: Ten years in retail banking operations, self-taught Python developer for two years.
    Opening: I spent a decade on the operations side of banking, watching technology decisions
    get made by people who had never processed a wire transfer or resolved a failed ACH batch.
    That frustration turned into curiosity, and two years of self-teaching Python later, I'm
    ready to be on the other side of those decisions. I'm applying to [Company] because your
    work on payment infrastructure is exactly where my domain expertise and new technical skills
    intersect.

    Now write an opening paragraph for this person:
    Role: {job_title}
    Background: {background}
    Opening:

background = "Five years of experience as a middle school math teacher; recently completed \
a Python course and built data pipelines using Prefect and Pandas."

generate_cover_letter(job_title, background)

# I chose these examples because they show career changers connecting past experience to a new role in a specific, confident way. The few-shot pattern helps control the tone, structure, and level of detail so the output feels tailored instead of generic.

# Task 6: Ethic Reflection

# 1. What could go wrong if a job-seeker submitted the bot's output directly — without reviewing it — to a real employer?

# It's so crucial to review what the bot generates, becuase if we don't do that, first of all , it may become clear that it was bot generated which shows unauthenticity and lack of effort. Also, the bot may generate content that is inaccurate, exaggerated, or not aligned with the job seeker's actual experience and skills, which could lead to credibility issues or even disqualification from the job application process. It would show candidate's laziness and lck of genuine interest in the position, which could be a red flag for employers.


# 2. Your bot was trained on text written by and about certain kinds of people. How might this produce biased advice? Could it favor certain communication styles, industries, or cultural backgrounds?

# The bot's training data likely includes a disproportionate amount of content from certain industries (like tech), communication styles (like corporate or startup culture), and cultural backgrounds (like Western norms). This could lead the bot to favor advice that aligns with those dominant patterns, potentially disadvantaging job seekers from underrepresented industries, non-Western cultures, or those who communicate in less conventional ways. For example, it might suggest resume formats or cover letter tones that are more common in tech or corporate settings, which may not resonate with employers in creative fields or in different cultural contexts.
