# API Q2:

prompt = "Suggest a creative name for a data engineering consultancy."
temperatures = [0, 0.7, 1.5]

for temp in temperatures:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",

        temperature=temp
    )
    print("Temperature:", temp)
    print("Response:", response.choices[0].message.content)

# As temperature increases, the responses become more creative and less deterministic. At temperature 0, the model gives a very straightforward and common name. At 0.7, the name is more unique and imaginative. At 1.5, the name is quite unconventional and may be less relevant to a data engineering consultancy, demonstrating increased creativity but decreased coherence. For personal choice, middle ground (0.7) often provides a good balance between creativity and relevance. But in some cases, a higher temperature might be preferred for brainstorming sessions where out-of-the-box ideas are desired. Especially for creative branding names, a higher temperature can yield more unique and memorable suggestions. If middle temperature doesn't satisfy me, I would analyze more creative version. Using below temperature has its own use cases. So it depends on the context and the desired outcome.

# API Q3:


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",

    max_tokens=15,
    temperature=0.5
)

print(f"Response text: {response.choices[0].message.content}")

# The response was cut off because max_tokens limits how many tokens the model can generate. if we put lower number of max_tokens, the model will generate shorter responses. This is useful to control cost and keep responses short and readable. If we want a more detailed answer, we can increase the max_tokens limit.

# Why does the model know Jordan's name, even though it's stateless?

# The model knows Jordan's name because we included it in the message history. Even though the API is stateless, we send the full conversation each time, so the model can read earlier messages and use that information.

A large language model is a powerful artificial intelligence system

human-like conversations, knowledge, and tasks. These models excel in 
processing complex information, understanding context, and generating 
coherent text, making them essential in fields like healthcare, finance, 
and education.
"""

# The Ollama response was simpler and less detailed compared to the OpenAI response, which was more polished and informative.
# One advantage of running a model locally is that it can be free to use after setup and does not require internet access.
# One disadvantage is that smaller local models are less powerful and may produce less accurate or less detailed responses compared to larger cloud-based models.
