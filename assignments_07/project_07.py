# Task 5: Reflection

# --- Reflection ---
#
# 1. In Query 3, the agent communicated statistical significance by reporting
#    the p-value along with the Pearson correlation coefficient. It correctly
#    treated the correlation as statistically significant when the p-value was
#    less than 0.05, which is a common threshold in statistics.
#
# 2. One surprising response was when the agent generated matplotlib code on
#    its own to create the regional happiness line chart. I expected it to
#    rely mostly on tools, but it was able to write custom plotting code and
#    save the figure correctly without a dedicated plotting tool.
#
# 3. One additional useful tool would be a "compare_countries" tool that lets
#    users compare multiple countries across several years. It could calculate
#    trends, averages, and ranking changes over time. This would help answer
#    questions like: "How did the happiness scores of the United States and
#    Canada change between 2015 and 2020?"
