# scikit-learn Question 1
# Create a LinearRegression model, fit it to this data, and then predict the salary for someone with 4 years of experience and someone with 8 years. Print the slope (model.coef_[0]), the intercept (model.intercept_), and the two predictions. Label each printed value.


years = np.array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10]).reshape(-1, 1)
salary = np.array([45000, 50000, 60000, 75000, 90000, 120000])

# scikit-learn Question 2: Why to have 2d in X shape.

x = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

reshaped_x = x.reshape(-1, 1)

# Sckit-learn expects the input features (X) to be in a 2D array format, because it is a matrix of shape, so needs num_samples and num_features, otherwise it won't work. if we give only one array, it won't know is it a sample of features or a single feature, so it needs to be reshaped to 2D.

# Linear Regression Question 1:


np.random.seed(42)
num_patients = 100
age = np.random.randint(20, 65, num_patients).astype(float)
smoker = np.random.randint(0, 2, num_patients).astype(float)
cost = 200 * age + 15000 * smoker + np.random.normal(0, 3000, num_patients)

# Before fitting anything, look at the data. Create a scatter plot of age on the x-axis and cost on the y-axis. Color the points by smoker status by passing c=smoker and cmap="coolwarm" to plt.scatter(). Add a title "Medical Cost vs Age", label both axes, and save to outputs/cost_vs_age.png.

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(age, cost, c=smoker, cmap="coolwarm", edgecolor="k", alpha=0.7)
plt.title("Medical Cost vs Age")
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Cost")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("outputs/cost_vs_age.png")
plt.show()

# The non-smokers (c=0, cool colors) form a lower‐cost cluster,
# while smokers (c=1, warm colors) are distinctly higher cost—
# smoking status is clearly a strong predictor of medical cost.


# Linear Regression Question2: Split the data into training and test sets using age as the only feature, an 80/20 split, and random_state=42. Reshape age to a 2D array before using it as X. Print the shapes of all four arrays.


reshaped_age = age.reshape(-1, 1)


reshaped_age_train, reshaped_age_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    reshaped_age, cost, test_size=0.2, random_state=42

print(f"Shape of reshaped_age_test: {reshaped_age_test.shape}")
print(f"Shape of y_train: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"Shape of y_test: {y_test.shape}")

# Linear Regression Question 3

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(reshaped_age_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(reshaped_age_test)

print("Slope:", model.coef_[0])
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)

rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((y_pred - y_test) ** 2))
r2_age_only = model.score(reshaped_age_test, y_test)

print("RMSE:", rmse)
print("R² on the test set:", r2_age_only)

# The slope represents the relationship between age and medical cost.
# For each additional year of age, the model predicts that medical cost increases by about $196 dollars. This suggests that older patients tend to have higher medical costs on average.


# Linear Regression Question 4: Now add smoker as a second feature and fit a new model.
X_full = np.column_stack([age, smoker])

X_full_train, X_full_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_full, cost, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
print(f"Shape of X_full_train: {X_full_train.shape}")
print(f"Shape of X_full_test: {X_full_test.shape}")
print(f"Shape of y_train: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"Shape of y_test: {y_test.shape}")

model_full = LinearRegression()
model_full.fit(X_full_train, y_train)
y_pred_2 = model_full.predict(X_full_test)

print("age coefficient:    ", model_full.coef_[0])
print("smoker coefficient: ", model_full.coef_[1])
print("Intercept:", model_full.intercept_)

rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((y_pred_2 - y_test) ** 2))
r2_with_smoker = model_full.score(X_full_test, y_test)

# The smoker coefficient represents the difference in medical cost between
# smokers and non-smokers. Since smoker is 0 or 1, being a smoker increases
# the predicted medical cost by about 15,000 dollars, holding age constant.

print("RMSE:", rmse)

print("R² without smoker:", r2_age_only)
print("R² with smoker:   ", r2_with_smoker)


# Interpretation:
#  - Each additional year of age increases expected cost by about $200.
#  - Being a smoker (smoker=1 versus 0) increases expected cost by about $15,000,
#    holding age constant.  This spike confirms smoking status is the dominant driver of cost.

# Linear Regression Question 5:

max_val = max(max(y_test), max(y_pred_2))
min_val = min(min(y_test), min(y_pred_2))

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.scatter(y_pred_2, y_test, color="blue", alpha=0.7)
